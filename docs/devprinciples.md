Key Development Practices to Adopt
1. The Single Responsibility Principle
Each component should have one job. Right now, your main function is like a Swiss Army knife - it does everything, which makes it hard to maintain any one thing well.
2. Dependency Inversion
Your code creates its own dependencies (like instantiating the Whisper model directly in the UI). Better practice is to inject dependencies, making components more flexible and testable.
3. Error Boundaries
Real applications fail gracefully. Your app has some error handling, but it's inconsistent. Professional development means anticipating failure modes and handling them elegantly rather than letting the app crash.
4. State Management Discipline
Complex state management (like your session state juggling) is often a sign that the architecture needs simplification. Good apps have predictable, minimal state.
Architectural Thinking
Layered Architecture
Think of your app in layers:

Presentation Layer: How users interact (Streamlit UI)
Business Logic Layer: What your app actually does (transcription, processing)
Data Layer: How you store and retrieve information (files, session state)

Each layer should only talk to the layer directly below it, never skipping levels.
The Dependency Graph
Every time one part of your code imports or calls another part, you create a dependency. Complex dependency graphs make apps fragile. The goal is to minimize and organize these dependencies clearly.
Growth and Scalability Mindset
Start Simple, Evolve Intentionally
Your instinct to add features is good, but each addition should strengthen the foundation rather than making it more complex. Ask "Does this new feature fit naturally into my existing structure, or am I bolting it on?"
The Testing Pyramid
As you add features, you need confidence that changes don't break existing functionality. This requires designing code that can be tested in isolation.
Configuration vs. Code
Things that change frequently (like Discord webhook URLs) should be configurable without code changes. Things that define behavior should be in code.
Professional Development Practices
Version Control Hygiene
Make small, focused commits that do one thing. This makes it easier to track down bugs and understand the evolution of your codebase.
Documentation as Design Tool
Writing clear documentation forces you to think about your app's interface and purpose. If something is hard to document, it's probably poorly designed.
Performance vs. Premature Optimization
Your app works, but as it grows, you'll face performance questions. The principle is: make it work, make it right, then make it fast - in that order.
